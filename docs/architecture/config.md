# Minutes configuration reference

Minutes uses a single optional TOML file for all configuration. Everything has a compiled-in default, so Minutes works with no config file at all.

## Where it lives

- **macOS / Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/minutes/config.toml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, otherwise `~/.config/minutes/config.toml`.
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\minutes\config.toml`.

Settings → **Advanced** → **Open** in the desktop app opens this file in your default editor. The Settings panel only exposes the fields users ask about most often; everything else lives here.

## Precedence

`compiled defaults → config file override → CLI flag override`

So `minutes record --device "MacBook Pro Microphone"` always wins over `[recording] device = "AirPods"`, which itself wins over the default "use system default".

## Sections

### `[transcription]` — local ASR

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `engine` | `"auto"` | `"auto"` selects sherpa Parakeet v3 on Apple Silicon when the build includes `engine-sherpa` and the model is installed, otherwise Whisper. Explicit `"whisper"` and `"sherpa"` keep their meanings; `"parakeet"` remains a retained, currently unavailable sidecar preference. |
| `model` | `"base"` | Whisper model: `tiny` / `base` / `small` / `medium` / `large-v3` |
| `parakeet_model` | `"tdt-ctc-110m"` | Parakeet model: `tdt-ctc-110m` or `tdt-600m` |
| `language` | auto-detect | BCP-47 tag (e.g. `"en"`, `"es"`) to force a specific language |
| `noise_reduction` | `true` | RNNoise pre-filter (requires `denoise` feature) |
| `vad_model` | `"silero-v6.2.0"` | Silero VAD model name; empty string disables |
| `vad_engine` | `"whisper-silero"` | Recording sidecar VAD. `"ort-silero"` is opt-in and needs a build with the `vad-ort` feature plus `silero-vad-v6.2.0.onnx` in `model_path`; otherwise it falls back to whisper-silero with a warning |
| `min_words` | `3` | Drop utterances with fewer than this many words |
| `parakeet_binary` | `"parakeet"` | PATH lookup or absolute path to the parakeet binary |
| `parakeet_sidecar_enabled` | auto | Records future warm-sidecar intent. The current pathname-only process cannot receive Minutes' anonymous/sealed private-audio capability, so Linux, macOS, and Windows all use Whisper. Auto/`true` cannot bypass this gate; `"off"` forces off. A legacy bool `false` is treated as auto (pre-0.18.8 saves wrote it into every config) (#295). |
| `parakeet_fp16` | `false` | Reserved for a future supported GPU transport; currently not forwarded on Linux |
| `parakeet_boost_limit` / `parakeet_boost_score` | `0` / `2.0` | Knowledge-graph phrase boosting; 0 = off |
| `name_correction` | `"off"` | Post-pass name correction against attendees and vocabulary. Values: `"off"` or `"conservative"`; off by default. |

VAD files are resolved under `model_path`: `ggml-silero-v6.2.0.bin`, plus
`silero-vad-v6.2.0.onnx` when `vad_engine = "ort-silero"`. Run
`minutes setup --vad` to download only those files into that directory without
changing `transcription.model`.

### `[diarization]` — speaker attribution

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `engine` | `"none"` | `"none"` or `"pyannote-rs"` |
| `model` | `"legacy"` | `"legacy"` (segmentation-3.0 + CAM++) or opt-in `"community-1"` |
| `threshold` | `0.4` | Cosine similarity cutoff; lower merges more aggressively |
| `embedding_model` | `"cam++"` | Legacy-only override: `"cam++"` or `"cam++-lm"` (lower EER, lower similarities) |

See [Diarization model sets](diarization.md) for installation, licensing, and
the compatibility boundary with saved voice profiles.

### `[summarization]` — post-record summaries

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `engine` | `"none"` | `"none"`, `"auto"`, `"agent"`, `"ollama"`, `"openai-compatible"`, `"claude"`, `"openai"`, `"mistral"` |
| `agent_command` | `"claude"` | CLI to shell out to when engine = `"agent"` (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, `agent` / Cursor Agent, etc.) |
| `ollama_url` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server URL |
| `ollama_model` | `"llama3.2"` | Model name pulled in Ollama |
| `openai_compatible_base_url` | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | OpenAI-compatible base URL. Minutes appends `/chat/completions` unless it is already present. |
| `openai_compatible_model` | `"llama3.2"` | Model name for the compatible endpoint. |
| `openai_compatible_api_key_env` | unset | Optional environment variable name containing the API key. Leave blank for local servers. The desktop app can also save a gateway key in macOS Keychain and use that runtime secret for non-local endpoints without rewriting shared config. |
| `mistral_model` | `"mistral-large-latest"` | Mistral API model |
| `chunk_max_tokens` | `4000` | Max tokens per chunk when splitting long transcripts |
| `speaker_mapping_timeout_secs` | `30` | Tight timeout for the Level-1 speaker-naming LLM call. On the agent path it also runs with no MCP servers and no tools so it can't hang on init. Clamped to [5, 120]. |

For Pi coding-agent support, use `engine = "agent"` with `agent_command = "pi"`.
Minutes invokes Pi in non-interactive, no-tools mode. This is distinct from
Inflection's Pi models; do not route transcript data to Inflection unless the
user explicitly opts into that provider and its data terms.

For OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, Cloudflare AI Gateway, llama.cpp,
LM Studio, vLLM, LocalAI, or any other OpenAI-compatible server, use one
generic backend instead of adding a provider-specific engine:

The local path is simplest and does not require an API key. In the desktop app,
cloud gateways can be set up from Settings by pasting a key once; Minutes stores
it in macOS Keychain, keeps the raw secret out of `config.toml`, and leaves this
shared config field blank unless you explicitly choose an env-var-driven setup.

For CLI and power-user setups, set the key in your environment and put only the
variable name in config. Minutes never stores the raw key in `config.toml`.

```toml
[summarization]
engine = "openai-compatible"
openai_compatible_base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
openai_compatible_model = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
openai_compatible_api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
```

Local servers can omit the API key env:

```toml
[summarization]
engine = "openai-compatible"
openai_compatible_base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
openai_compatible_model = "llama3.2"
openai_compatible_api_key_env = ""
```

Screenshot context requires an endpoint that accepts OpenAI-style image content
parts. Text-only summaries use plain string chat content for broader local
server compatibility.

### `[copilot]` — real-time nudge stream

This section is deliberately separate from `[summarization]`: the copilot is a
latency-bounded live consumer, while summarization runs after recording. An
explicit `minutes copilot start` may start a foreground session when
`enabled = false`; the flag controls implicit startup by future host surfaces.

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Allow implicit copilot startup; explicit CLI startup remains available. |
| `surface` | `"tui"` | Default CLI surface: `"tui"` or newline-delimited JSON with `"stdout"`. |
| `mode` | `"generic"` | Default session policy: `sales`, `discovery`, `interview`, `negotiation`, `difficult-conversation`, `decision`, or `generic`; `--mode` overrides it. |
| `fast_provider` | `"auto-local"` | Fast-lane provider request. `"auto-local"` probes eligible local providers at session start and selects a healthy model within the routing policy; Apple Foundation Models remains a provider stub until the separate native fast-follow lands. |
| `fast_model` | `"qwen3.5:4b"` | Ollama model used for structured nudges. `minutes coach setup` replaces manifest defaults with the strongest hardware-fit model that passes its latency probe. |
| `allow_cloud` | `false` | Cloud opt-in gate. Cloud adapters are intentionally not implemented in the first copilot release. |
| `meeting_goal` | unset | Optional default outcome Coach should optimize for. |
| `arming_behavior` | `"ask-each-meeting"` | Desktop behavior at recording start: `"automatic"`, `"ask-each-meeting"`, or `"off"` (manual starts remain available). |
| `critical_notifications_only` | `true` | Suppress non-critical Coach notifications. |
| `onboarding_seen` | `false` | Desktop first-run explainer state. Managed by the app. |
| `nudge_ttl_ms` | `12000` | Lifetime of a rendered nudge in milliseconds. |
| `target_latency_ms` | `5000` | Fast request timeout/latency target; timeout degrades only the copilot. |
| `history_grounding` | `true` | Refresh a bounded battle card asynchronously from unrestricted graph, structured intent, and FTS data. |
| `live_partials` | `true` | Enable ephemeral partial coaching. Standalone Live publishes in process; normal Recording publishes the same replaceable current-speech evidence through its authenticated local capture relay. Finalized transcript lines remain the only durable evidence. |
| `partial_debounce_ms` | `250` | Coalesce rapid partial corrections before starting the fast model lane. |
| `depth_refresh_secs` | `60` | Slow strategy refresh cadence, clamped to 30–90 seconds; topic shifts and decisive finals may refresh earlier. |
| `grounding_refresh_secs` | `15` | Minimum stable-final grounding cadence; topic shifts bypass it. Retrieval never runs on capture or the fast path. |

Ollama defaults to `http://localhost:11434`. Set `OLLAMA_HOST` to use another
local endpoint. Meeting text and history are passed as delimited untrusted data,
the loop exposes no tools, and restricted meetings are excluded from every
battle-card source. Dismissed/helpful/not-helpful feedback changes only bounded
session cadence and confidence gates. See
[RFC 0004](../rfcs/0004-copilot-realtime-stream.md).

### `[recording]` — capture behavior

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `device` | unset | Explicit input device name; falls back to system default |
| `silence_reminder_secs` | `300` | Seconds of silence before a reminder notification; 0 = off |
| `silence_threshold` | `3` | RMS energy level (0–100) below which audio is silence |
| `silence_auto_stop_secs` | `1800` | Seconds of silence before auto-stop; 0 = off |
| `max_duration_secs` | `28800` | Hard recording cap (default 8h); 0 = off |
| `min_disk_space_mb` | `500` | Auto-stop when free disk space drops below this; 0 = off |
| `auto_call_intent` | `false` | Infer call intent from process detection (high false-positive rate) |
| `allow_degraded_call_capture` | `false` | Allow call capture when selected input isn't a system-audio route |
| `capture_backend` | `"cpal"` | `"cpal"` for loopback devices, `"core-audio-tap"` on macOS 14.4+, or opt-in `"pocketstation"` application capture on Windows and Linux |

### `[recording.sources]` — multi-source capture

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `voice` | unset | Voice (mic) device name, or `"default"` |
| `call` | unset | Call audio device, or `"auto"` to detect loopback. PocketStation accepts an application name, application ID, or `pid:<process id>` |

When `capture_backend = "core-audio-tap"`, set `call = "auto"`. The backend
captures the default macOS system output via Core Audio Process Tap instead of
opening a named loopback input device.

When `capture_backend = "pocketstation"`, choose the application in `call`.
Minutes then records that application and the selected microphone as separate
stems on Windows or Linux. See
[PocketStation capture](pocketstation-capture.md) for build and configuration
instructions.

### `[consent]` — recording disclosure aid

For meeting recordings, Minutes can show a disclosure reminder, ask for an
interactive acknowledgement, and write the selected basis into frontmatter.
Non-interactive callers are never blocked: if `mode = "require"` is used from
a non-TTY process without `--consent`, Minutes records the basis as
`unattested` and prints a warning.

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `"remind"` | `"off"` skips reminder text, `"remind"` prints the script, `"require"` asks for an interactive acknowledgement only when stdin is a TTY |
| `disclosure_script` | built-in local transcript disclosure | One-line script to read aloud or paste before recording |
| `default_basis` | unset | Optional basis stamped when no `--consent` flag is provided |

Supported basis values are `verbal_all_parties`, `notice_in_invite`,
`recorded_disclosed`, `na`, and `unattested`.

```toml
[consent]
mode = "remind"
disclosure_script = "Heads up: I'm using Minutes to transcribe this conversation locally on my device for my own notes. Let me know if you'd prefer I didn't."
# default_basis = "notice_in_invite"
```

CLI flags override the config for a single recording:

```bash
minutes record --consent verbal_all_parties
minutes record --consent notice_in_invite --consent-notice "Notice was included in the calendar invite."
```

### Sensitive meeting frontmatter

`minutes sensitive start` opens a no-capture meeting session for typed markers.
`minutes sensitive stop` writes a regular markdown meeting artifact, but marks
the capture and sensitivity policy explicitly:

```yaml
capture: none
sensitivity: restricted
consent: na
debrief: pending
```

`debrief: pending` is present only when the session is saved without any typed
debrief content. Non-interactive callers never wait for prompts; they save the
artifact immediately and leave the debrief status for a later assistant pass.

### `[retention]` — raw audio policy

Minutes treats markdown transcripts, summaries, graph/search data, and metadata
as the durable library. Raw audio is a short-lived recovery/reprocessing layer
unless pinned.

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `successful_audio_days` | `30` | Days to keep raw audio for successfully processed recordings |
| `failed_audio_days` | `90` | Days to keep raw audio for failed or needs-review recordings |
| `restricted_audio_days` | `7` | Days to keep raw audio for `sensitivity: restricted` meetings (tighter window for sensitive content) |
| `keep_pinned_audio` | `true` | Keep audio when meeting frontmatter has `audio_retention: pinned` |
| `auto_cleanup` | `false` | Reserved for future automatic cleanup runners; current CLI cleanup requires explicit `--apply` |
| `cleanup_on_startup` | `false` | Reserved for future startup cleanup |
| `warn_above_gb` | `2` | Threshold for surfacing raw-audio storage warnings |

`restricted_audio_days` applies to meetings marked `sensitivity: restricted`:
sensitive content is held on a tighter window than normal recordings, and the
sensitivity tier takes precedence over the successful/failed classification. An
explicit `audio_retention: pinned` still wins (operator intent). Set it to `0`
to make restricted audio delete-eligible the day after recording.

Inspect storage with `minutes storage`. Preview cleanup with `minutes cleanup`;
delete candidates only with the explicit `minutes cleanup --apply`. As with all
retention, nothing is deleted automatically unless `auto_cleanup` is enabled.

### `[identity]` — who you are (for attribution)

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | unset | Your canonical name used in `"Mat said…"` attribution |
| `email` | unset | Legacy single email (backward-compat) |
| `emails` | `[]` | All addresses you send from; folded onto your canonical person entity |
| `aliases` | `[]` | Alternate name spellings (`["Mathieu", "Matt"]`) |

### `[dictation]` — dictation-mode behavior

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `backend` | `"whisper"` | Final transcription backend. Retained `"apple-speech"` and `"parakeet"` values resolve to sealed Whisper while their secure private-audio release gates remain closed. |
| `destination` | `"insert"` | `"insert"` puts the final text in the active app and on the clipboard; `"clipboard"`, `"file"`, and `"command"` remain available for explicit delivery workflows |
| `destination_file` | unset | Target file when `destination = "file"` |
| `destination_command` | unset | Shell command when `destination = "command"` |
| `accumulate` | `true` | Append successive utterances rather than replacing |
| `daily_note_log` | `true` | Append every dictation to the daily note |
| `auto_paste` | `false` | Paste the result immediately after dictation ends when the platform can do that honestly |
| `auto_paste_restore` | `true` | Preserve the previous clipboard during explicit re-paste and reprocess actions. Routine insert-mode dictation always leaves the final transcript on the clipboard. |
| `silence_timeout_ms` | `2000` | Silence threshold that ends a dictation session |
| `max_utterance_secs` | `120` | Force-finalize an utterance at this length |
| `model` | `"base"` | Whisper model for dictation |
| `cleanup_engine` | `"rules"` | Text cleanup applied to each utterance: `"rules"` (deterministic on-device: capitalization, fillers, vocab) or `"none"`/`"off"` for raw ASR. `"ollama"` is reserved and currently falls back to rules |
| `cleanup_remove_fillers` | `true` | Remove conservative filler words ("um", "uh") |
| `cleanup_spoken_punctuation` | `false` | Convert spoken commands ("period", "new line") to punctuation. Opt-in: collides with those words used as content |
| `cleanup_apply_vocabulary` | `false` | Apply your vocabulary store (Term/Acronym entries) as casing/replacement fixes (e.g. "gpt" → "GPT") |
| `voice_commands_enabled` | `true` | Apply only exact whole-utterance commands such as `scratch that`, `new line`, `new paragraph`, and `bullet`. Set to `false` to keep every phrase literal |
| `voice_snippets` | `{}` | Explicit local snippet map used only by `insert snippet <name>`, for example `voice_snippets = { "sign off" = "Best,\\nMat" }` |
| `history_policy` | `"recent"` | Keep successful dictations in recent history, or set `"off"` to retain only recoverable failures until they are resolved |

Voice edits are deliberately strict. Formatting commands require a separate
following utterance and are disabled for terminal/code and unknown targets.
`scratch that` removes one complete prior utterance only when other output will
remain. Confirmed spelling uses the full form `spell last word as capital m i n
u t e s confirm`. Applied edits retain the raw transcript, the cleaned text from
before commands, and local provenance in Dictation history. Bare `actually` is
always ordinary content.

Dictation clipboard behavior is platform-specific:

- macOS uses `pbcopy` / `pbpaste`; desktop auto-paste requires Accessibility permission and reports whether Minutes verified typing or only pasted.
- Linux clipboard output uses `wl-copy` / `wl-paste` from `wl-clipboard` on Wayland, or `xclip` / `xsel` on X11. Desktop auto-paste copies first, then tries `xdotool` only in an X11 session; Wayland remains copy-only because compositors do not expose one universal paste-injection path.
- Windows CLI clipboard output uses `clip.exe`; desktop active-app insertion is not claimed yet.

### `[watch]` — folder watcher

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `paths` | `[]` | Folders to watch for new audio files |
| `extensions` | `["wav","m4a","mp3","ogg"]` | Extensions to process |
| `type` | `"auto"` | `"auto"`, `"meeting"`, `"memo"` — routing override |
| `diarize` | `false` | Run diarization on watched files |
| `delete_source` | `false` | Move source to `processed/` after success |
| `settle_delay_ms` | `2000` | Wait for file to stop growing before processing |
| `dictation_threshold_secs` | `60` | Files shorter than this route as memos (skip diarization) |

### `[knowledge]` — LLM wiki integration

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Write facts to a markdown wiki after each meeting |
| `path` | unset | Wiki root (e.g. `~/Documents/life`) |
| `adapter` | `"wiki"` | `"wiki"`, `"para"`, `"obsidian"` |
| `engine` | `"none"` | `"agent"`, `"ollama"`, `"none"` |
| `agent_command` | `"claude"` | Agent CLI when engine = `"agent"` (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, `agent` / Cursor Agent, etc.) |
| `log_file` / `index_file` | `log.md` / `index.md` | Chronological + content-oriented index |
| `min_confidence` | `"strong"` | `"explicit"`, `"strong"`, `"inferred"`, `"tentative"` |

### `[vault]` — Obsidian / Logseq / markdown vault sync

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Sync meeting markdown into a vault |
| `path` | unset | Vault root |
| `meetings_subdir` | `"areas/meetings"` | Subfolder inside the vault |
| `strategy` | `"auto"` | `"auto"`, `"symlink"`, `"copy"`, `"direct"` |

### `[hooks]` — pipeline extensibility

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `post_record` | unset | Shell command run after each recording; transcript path appended as final arg |

### `[call_detection]` — automatic call awareness

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Detect active calls automatically |
| `poll_interval_secs` | `1` | How often to check for active calls |
| `cooldown_minutes` | `5` | Wait before re-triggering after a hangup |
| `apps` | `["zoom.us","Microsoft Teams","Webex"]` | App names to recognize |
| `stop_when_call_ends` | `false` | Show an auto-stop countdown when the call ends |
| `call_end_stop_countdown_secs` | `30` | Seconds before auto-stop fires |
| `any_mic_app` | `true` | Prompt when any other app holds the microphone (Slack huddles, Discord, FaceTime, any browser), labelled by that app. Apps in `apps` and the Meet/Teams web probes are checked first. |
| `prompt_card` | `true` | Ask with the floating "In a meeting?" card (Record / Not now / snooze) instead of an OS notification. Off falls back to the notification. |
| `ignored_apps` | `[]` | App names that never prompt. Added by "Never for <app>" on the card, removed in Settings > Call detection. |

### `[palette]` — command palette

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `shortcut_enabled` | `true` | Global shortcut on |
| `shortcut` | `"CmdOrCtrl+Shift+K"` | Chord; Settings dropdown offers preset alternatives |

### `[live_transcript]` — live transcription during recording

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | empty, meaning `dictation.model` | Whisper model for live mode. An empty value uses `dictation.model`, **not** `transcription.model`: live transcription is real-time and wants a small fast model, while batch transcription can afford a slower, more accurate one. Set this explicitly to decouple them. |
| `max_utterance_secs` | `30` | Force-finalize an utterance at this length |
| `save_wav` | `true` | Save raw WAV so the stopped session can be preserved or processed |
| `promote_on_stop` | `"process"` | `"process"` creates a normal meeting; `"preserve"` keeps a timestamped WAV/JSONL pair only; `"off"` leaves the overwrite-prone fixed slot unchanged |
| `shortcut_enabled` | `false` | Global shortcut on |
| `shortcut` | `"CmdOrCtrl+Shift+L"` | Chord |

### `[dictation]` global shortcut

Separate from the dictation-mode behavior section above. Controlled by the Settings UI or:

```toml
[dictation]
shortcut_enabled = true
shortcut = "CmdOrCtrl+Shift+Space"
hotkey_enabled = false
hotkey_keycode = 57   # Caps Lock (macOS) — requires Input Monitoring
```

### `[voice]` — voice enrollment

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Learn voices across recordings |
| `match_threshold` | `0.65` | Cosine similarity cutoff for voice enrollment matching |

### `[voice_live]` spoken assistant (RFC 0007)

Push-to-talk conversation with a realtime speech model over your meeting memory, run with `minutes talk` (built with the `voice-live` Cargo feature). Every fact it speaks comes from a tool call into minutes-core. It is a cloud provider: microphone audio and tool results leave the device, so it stays off until both `enabled` and `allow_cloud` are set. It never touches recording state and refuses to start while a recording is active. The existing `[voice]` section is speaker identification and is unrelated.

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch for the CLI command and, later, the desktop shortcut |
| `allow_cloud` | `false` | Explicit acknowledgement that microphone audio and tool results go to the provider |
| `provider` | `"gemini"` | Realtime provider. Only `"gemini"` today |
| `model` | `"gemini-3.8-live"` | Model id |
| `api_key_env` | `"GEMINI_API_KEY"` | Name of the environment variable holding the API key. The key itself is never stored in config |
| `language` | `"en-US"` | BCP-47 language for transcription and speech |
| `tool_scheduling` | `"when_idle"` | Deliver async tool results after the model finishes speaking (`"when_idle"`) or immediately (`"interrupt"`) |
| `max_tool_chars` | `12000` | Per-tool-result character budget so one transcript cannot fill the voice context |
| `known_people` | `200` | How many known names to inject as spelling bias |
| `brain_search` | `true` | Expose knowledge base search and read when `[knowledge].path` is set |
| `screen_on_request` | `false` | Expose `look_at_screen`, which captures one frame and sends it to the provider. Off by default because a screen frame is the most sensitive thing this feature can transmit. Pull-only: the model cannot take a frame Mat did not ask for |
| `prep_artifacts` | `true` | Expose the prep and brief files written by the `/minutes-prep` and `/minutes-brief` skills under `~/.minutes` |
| `calendar` | `true` | Expose upcoming calendar events. Also requires `[calendar] enabled` |
| `ask_agent` | `false` | Expose `ask_agent`, which relays one question to a local coding agent. Off by default. Only its answer travels onward, but the agent runs with whatever permissions it was given and Minutes cannot constrain it once asked, so `delegate_agent_args` is the control that matters |
| `delegate_agent` | `""` | Which agent CLI to relay to. Empty follows `[assistant] agent`, then the first agent CLI installed |
| `delegate_timeout_secs` | `120` | How long to wait for that agent |
| `delegate_agent_args` | `[]` | Launch flags for the relayed agent. Empty follows `[assistant] agent_args`. A relayed agent has no terminal, so it must not stop to ask for tool-use permission: nothing can answer the prompt and the call burns its whole timeout looking like a hang |
| `delegate_cwd` | `""` | Directory the relayed agent starts in. Empty uses the Minutes process directory, which for a desktop launch is not where any code lives |
| `desktop_control` | `false` | Let the assistant act on the Mac through a fixed catalogue of verbs: open an app or a page, reveal a file, control playback, add a reminder. The model picks a verb and fills typed parameters; it never writes AppleScript, and parameters reach the interpreter as `argv` rather than as source, so there is no injection to reason about |
| `desktop_outward` | `false` | Also allow the verbs that leave the machine, sending an iMessage or an email. Each is two-phase: the first call performs nothing and returns a sentence to read out loud plus a single-use token bound to those exact arguments, and only a second call carrying that token acts. Enforced in code, because a prompt asking the model to confirm is the control that already failed |
| `music` | `false` | Labs toy. Generate and play music, sung or instrumental, steered by what the assistant knows about a conversation. The model writes any lyrics itself and returns them alongside the audio. Deliberately separate from the memory features and off by default. Refuses while a recording is running, because music through the speakers reaches the microphone and then the transcript |
| `music_model` | `"lyria-3.5"` | Music model id |
| `music_max_secs` | `0` | Ceiling on how much of a piece to play, in seconds. `0` plays all of it. Music and speech share one output queue, which is what lets the echo canceller keep the music out of the microphone; the cost is that unprompted speech waits behind queued music, though talking flushes it. Every piece is kept whole under `~/.minutes/music` |
| `delegate_writes` | `false` | Let the relayed agent change things. Off by default: the caller is a cloud speech model deciding on its own when to relay, from audio it may have misheard, with nobody reviewing the request. RFC 0007 holds phase 1 to a single write, `add_note`, for that reason. Note this instructs the agent; narrowing its own tool access through `delegate_agent_args` is the enforcing control |
| `screen_settle_ms` | `150` | Spacing between closing the screen tool call and sending the frame that answers it |
| `mcp_servers` | `[]` | MCP servers to launch for a session, as `[[voice_live.mcp_servers]]` tables |

#### `[[voice_live.mcp_servers]]` connected services

Minutes publishes an MCP server; this is the other direction. Each entry launches a server as a child process, speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC to it over stdio, and merges its `tools/list` into the voice tool surface as `name__tool`. A server that fails to start is reported and skipped, never fatal to a session.

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | required | Short name prefixing every tool from this server |
| `command` | required | Executable to launch. Resolved like the agent CLI, so a bare `npx` works from a GUI bundle |
| `args` | `[]` | Arguments for it |
| `tools` | `[]` | Allowlist of tool names. Empty takes what fits under `max_tools` |
| `max_tools` | `8` | Cap on tools from this server. Voice context is small and tool choice degrades quickly, so keep it low |

Secrets are never named here. A server inherits the Minutes process environment and reads whatever variable it already expects.
| `log_sessions` | `true` | Write a `0600` markdown transcript of each session to `~/.minutes/voice-sessions/` |
| `echo_cancellation` | `true` | Also decides the default talk mode: open mic where cancellation exists, push-to-talk everywhere else, so no platform self-interrupts by default. |
| | | Run mic and speaker through one voice-processing unit so the speaker signal is cancelled out of the mic. macOS only today; elsewhere plain capture, so `minutes talk` defaults to push-to-talk and `--open-mic` warns |
| `proactive_audio` | `false` | Let the model decide not to answer. Open mic otherwise treats everything it hears as addressed to it, so a half sentence to someone else, or noise a transcriber turns into words, becomes a prompt. Ignored in push-to-talk, where the user has already said every turn is for it. Off by default because an unsupported setup field fails the whole session |
| `speech_start_sensitivity` | `"low"` | Provider speech-start detection on open mic: `"low"`, `"high"`, or `""` for the provider default |
| `speech_end_sensitivity` | `"low"` | Provider speech-end detection on open mic: `"low"`, `"high"`, or `""` for the provider default |

### `[screen_context]` — recording-time screenshots

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Capture periodic screenshots during recording |
| `interval_secs` | `30` | Seconds between captures |
| `keep_after_summary` | `false` | Retain screenshots after summarization |

This section is intentionally narrow:

- it only affects screenshots during an active recording
- it is off by default
- it is not a general ambient desktop-capture mode
- it is independent of `[desktop_context]`, which stores app/window metadata
- screenshots are retrieved on demand with `minutes context screen` or the
  read-only MCP `get_screen_context` tool; they are not attached to every query
- assistants must not claim they can see the screen unless they opened or were
  delivered a specific returned image

Use `minutes context status --json` to inspect the observed runtime state. Use
`minutes context screen --session <id> --at <rfc3339-time> --limit 1 --json` to
retrieve bounded, verified PNG paths nearest a meeting moment. A limit above
three is rejected. When `keep_after_summary` is false, cleanup removes both the
PNG files and their readable context-store references.

### `[desktop_context]` — meeting-adjacent app/window context

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Capture app/window context during recordings and live sessions |
| `capture_window_titles` | `true` | Include focused window titles when macOS Accessibility is available |
| `capture_browser_context` | `false` | Opt in to browser-page title context (URL/domain enrichment remains deferred) |
| `allowed_apps` | `[]` | Optional allowlist of app or bundle-id fragments |
| `denied_apps` | `[]` | Optional denylist of app or bundle-id fragments |

This section is the policy layer for meeting-adjacent desktop context:

- it is off by default
- it applies to recording/live-session context, not a 24/7 ambient mode
- app filters are enforced today
- domain lists are forward-compatible policy hooks for future browser URL enrichment

### `[search]` — search backend

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `engine` | `"builtin"` | `"builtin"` or `"qmd"` |
| `qmd_collection` | unset | Collection name when engine = `"qmd"` |

### `[daily_notes]` — daily note integration

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Append dictations / memos to daily notes |
| `path` | derived | Override daily-note folder |

### `[security]` — access restrictions

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `allowed_audio_dirs` | `[]` | If non-empty, only these dirs can be opened via `minutes open` |

### `[privacy]` — privacy toggles

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `hide_from_screen_share` | `true` | Exclude the Minutes window from screen sharing |

### `[assistant]` — Claude / Codex / Gemini integration

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | `"claude"` | Which CLI to spawn for the Recall panel |
| `agent_args` | `[]` | Extra launch flags (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--model sonnet`, etc.) |

### `[calendar]` — calendar source

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Read upcoming meetings from the system calendar |
| `use_event_title_for_meeting_title` | `false` | When a recording overlaps a scheduled calendar event, use that event's title as the meeting title instead of the AI-generated one (skips the LLM title refine for that meeting) |
| `system_calendar` | `true` | Read the Mac system calendar (Apple Calendar, iCloud, Exchange via Internet Accounts). Set `false` to ignore it and rely on `ics_url` alone, e.g. when the system calendar is personal. |
| `ics_url` | unset | Published iCalendar feed (`https://` or `webcal://`) merged with the system calendar. Use it for Outlook/Exchange when the account is not in Apple Calendar (Outlook web > Settings > Calendar > Shared calendars > Publish, copy the ICS link). Refreshed every 5 minutes; recurring meetings are expanded from the feed's own rules and time zones; all-day events are ignored. Treat the URL as a secret. |

### `[ui]` — desktop app chrome

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `language` | `"auto"` | Display language: `auto`, `en`, `zh-CN`, `pt-BR` |
| `dictation_hud_anchor` | `"top_center"` | Remembered screen edge for the dictation HUD; updated when you drag it |
| `recording_hud_enabled` | `true` | Show the floating recording pill (timer, pause, stop) while the desktop app records. Pause drops audio; the transcript gets a `Recording paused` / `Recording resumed` note at the cut. |
| `recording_hud_anchor` | `"bottom_right"` | Remembered screen corner for the recording pill; updated when you drag it |

### `output_dir` — top-level

Default: `~/meetings` on Unix, `%USERPROFILE%\meetings` on Windows. Change to route everywhere meeting output lives — recordings, memos, processed/, failed-captures/. The desktop app exposes this under Settings → Advanced → Storage → Change, which can also move the existing notes into the new folder and re-points a symlinked vault.

## What's not in this file

Runtime-only signals (detected audio devices, model provenance metadata, speaker voice embeddings) live under `~/.minutes/` and aren't user-configurable via TOML. Most are regenerated on demand; a few (voice profiles) persist across rebuilds via `~/.minutes/voices.db`.

## Contributing

If you add a config field, please update this reference so the Advanced → View docs surface doesn't drift. The CI guard in `tauri/src-tauri/src/commands.rs` (`every_cmd_set_setting_arm_has_a_caller`) catches one specific class of drift — arms with no UI AND no internal caller — but it doesn't enforce documentation. That's on us.
